## Install üíæ

Start of by cloning this repo or downloading the zip file.
After that open up your terminal and run these commands:

```
cd ProjectFolder
pnpm install
```

#### Setup Blockchain üîó

Next step is to get the Hardhat blockchain node running locally

```bash
cd /path_to_project/MultisigWallet/blockchain
pnpm hardhat node
```

Then test, compile and deploy the contracts

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm compile

pnpm hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost
```

#### Start Client üåê

Finally get the client site running on localhost with the Hardhat node. We need to change a few things:

Open up `/client/src/utils.ts` and update the function `getPublicClent()` to this:

```typescript
export function getPublicClient() {
    return createPublicClient({
        chain: hardhat,
        transport: http('http://127.0.0.1:8545'),
    });
}
```

Open a new Terminal window and run:

```bash
cd client/
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

Head over to `http://localhost:5173` and start using MultisigWallet!

> Note: Make sure to update your Metamask to use the local network as well. [Check out step 5 in the MetaMask Developer docs](https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/how-to/get-started-building/run-devnet/)
